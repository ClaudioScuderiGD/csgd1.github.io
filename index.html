                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, I have been very curious and have cultivated many interests.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To list a few of them they ranged from astronomy to technology, from extreme sports to film, books, anime and mangas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore I have always been immensely attracted to videogames and competitions, during my childhood I would watch my two brothers playing on a console all the time, and I still remember vividly the fun I had when I first played.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That's how this passion of mine was born, and ever since that moment I knew I wanted to work with something related to games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With that in mind I decided to study Computer Science at university, and after one year I realized how I was slightly off-target. My main objective was not to script functions to move my character, I wanted to create meaningful experiences and to design the game world and its systems. For this reason I opted for an education that covered the topics I was more interested in, and that would be Game Design.​
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I will soon graduate in Game Design at Event Horizon School. Over the past couple of years I worked on many game projects in teams. I enjoyed tackling a wide variety of challenges and have developed my skills in multiple aspects of game development, amongst which game, combat, level, and system design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My objective is to professionally craft accessible and impactful experiences that will leave a mark in the industry and a lasting impression on the player.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are curious about my favourite games at the moment, they are: Elden Ring, Hollow Knight and League of Legends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to add many more titles to cover other genres that I love like survivals and battle royales but I'm gonna stick with those three for now. 
                    I didn't expect for you to read until here, but I thank you and I hope I didn't take too much of your time.
                    Want to know anything else about me? For further inquiries, here are my contacts.
